# Advisory Disclosure (v1.0)

No Advisory Relationship. During beta, we are not a registered investment adviser. Use of the Service does not create a fiduciary, advisory, or brokerage relationship.

Hypothetical Performance. Any returns are hypothetical and subject to assumptions and data errors. Actual results will differ.

AI Explanations. The chatbot provides educational explanations of model outputs and does not make personalized recommendations.

When Registered. Upon launch of live investing, we will provide Form CRS and Form ADV disclosures, including fees, conflicts, and how to contact our Chief Compliance Officer.
